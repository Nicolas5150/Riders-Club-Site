            The Trail Care Crew has officially left the building and looking
            back on <br /> the weekend I have to say it was a huge success.
            Steve and Morgan <br /> arrived last Thursday and they&#39;re first
            stop was Mountain park where <br /> Richard and Ben gave them the
            full tour of the trail system.

            Thursday night MR held the monthly club meeting a little bit early
            at one <br /> of the best restaurants in town and a big supporter,
            Roadhouse. While <br /> we all dined on the Roadhouse&#39;s awesome
            food and beverages, Steve <br /> and Morgan presented us with a
            brief presentation. The topic of the <br /> meeting was how to
            strengthen the club, fundraising ideas and some <br /> pointers
            on how to promote member involvement. The meeting was <br />
            interesting and a nice change of pace from our usual subject.

            Friday we kicked things off at 9am with MRC&#39;s "Better Living
            Through <br /> Trails" presentation. The crew discussed the low
            cost of trail <br /> construction and maintenance in comparison to
            the development and <br /> maintenance of other recreational sports
            and activities. Steve and <br /> Morgan boasted the abilities and
            efforts of the MRC and future projects <br /> and partnerships are
            now being discussed as a result of the meeting. <br />
